# Work Day Scheduler 



## About the project 

The HTML file provides the structure for a simple workday scheduler web application. It includes a header with a title and description, followed by a container for time blocks representing standard business hours from 9AM to 5PM. Each time block consists of a row with an hour display, a textarea for entering events, and a save button.

The JavaScript file enhances the functionality of the scheduler. It ensures that all interactions with the DOM are executed only after the browser has finished rendering all elements.

## User Story
